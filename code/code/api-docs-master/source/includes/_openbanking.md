**The TransferWise Open Banking API is aimed for Financially Regulated Third Party Providers who can prove their regulatory status either by being a member of the [Open Banking Directory](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/providers/directory/) or possessing an [eIDAS Certificate](#open-banking-sandbox-access). Third Parties or individuals who do not meet these requirements are welcome to check out our [Public API](#transferwise-api).** 

The TransferWise Open Banking API is a collection of RESTful APIs that enable Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access account information, initiate payments and confirm availability of funds on behalf of TransferWise customers. The API implementation follows the [Open Banking UK standard](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/api-specifications/), and TransferWise is a registered member of the [Open Banking Directory](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/providers/directory/).

Through this API you can either query account information, if you're an Account Information Service Provider (**AISP**), initiate payments, if you're a Payment Initiation Service Provider (**PISP**), or confirm the availability of funds, if you're a Card Based Payment Instrument Issuer (**CBPII**). We are currently supporting version [3.1.1](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/api-specifications/read-write-specs/v3-1-1/) of the Open Banking API.

## Prerequisites

> Well-Known Open Banking URL in Sandbox

```shell
https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

> Well-Known Open Banking URL in Production

```shell
https://transferwise.com/openbanking/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

There's a couple of things you should be aware of in order to connect to the TransferWise Open Banking API:

* Being a registered TPP under the Open Banking Directory will ease the integration process.
* We are using [mutualTLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-17) as the means for authentication. Moreover, the `CN` of your client certificate is expected to match the `clientId` under which you are registered. 
* You need to register your client, before you'll be able to call any of the APIs. Check out the [Sandbox Access](#open-banking-sandbox-access) first.

For a detailed description of requirements and supported algorithms please check out the Well-Known Open Banking URL.

## Sandbox Access

We highly recommend that you get started with connecting to our sandbox first, before moving on to production. To get started with the registration process drop us an email to [openbanking@transferwise.com](mailto:openbanking@transferwise.com).

### Open Banking Directory

If you're a registered TPP in the Open Banking Directory you will probably be using a Signing and a Transport certificates issued by
Open Banking. At the moment we accept the old style OB Transport and OB Signing certificates.

**You can easily onboard by providing a Software Statement Assertion (SSA) generated in the Open Banking Directory.**

Please make sure to have your list of **Redirect Uri**-s correctly configured in your Software Statement, otherwise you'll not be able to go through the whole flow.

### eIDAS Certificates

In case you're using an eIDAS certificates instead of the ones issued by the Open Banking Directory just contact us at [openbanking@transferwise.com](mailto:openbanking@transferwise.com) to 
see how we can move forward. 

## Sandbox Test User

You can sign up for a test user account here [https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/register](https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/register). The 2FA code used for any subsequent logins to the sandbox will alway be `111111`.

You'll be asked to set up a developer account by filling in your profile information. Once this is done, you'll see that your newly created profile comes with a couple of test accounts opened and some test funds in them.

You do **NOT** need to create an API Token via the web interface in case you're intention is to use this test user for the Open Banking flow.

## Sandbox Test Flow

After you've successfully applied for the [Sandbox Access](#open-banking-sandbox-access) and you've set up a [Sandbox Test User](#open-banking-sandbox-test-user) you are ready to test the Open Banking flow.
For the purpose of this test flow let's assume that your TPP is an AISP and it's registered with the following details

Client ID    | Redirect URI                   | Authorized Scopes
---------    | ---------                      | ----------
ob-dummy-tpp | https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect  | accounts

## 1. Create an Access Token

> Example Token Request

```shell 
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=accounts'
```

> Example Response

```json
{
    "access_token": "abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-abcdef123456",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 6000,
    "scope": "accounts openbanking"
}
```

As a first step you'll need to request an access token from the Token Endpoint.  

### Request

**`POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token`**

Field          | Description            | Format
---------      | -------                | -----------
grant_type     | OAuth Grant Type       | `client_credentials`
scope          | The requested scopes   | Space separated list 

You must include the requested scope in your token request. As an AISP your requested scope will be `accounts`.

### Response

Field          | Description                                | Format
---------      | -------                                    | ---------
access_token   | The access token                           | Text
expires_in     | Expiration time in seconds                 | Long
scope          | The scopes you have been given access to   | Text   

## 2. Create a Consent

> Example Create Consent Request

```shell 
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/account-access-consents \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer abcd1234-abcd-1234-abcd-abcdef123456' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "Data": {
    "Permissions": [
      "ReadAccountsBasic", "ReadTransactionsBasic", "ReadTransactionsDebits"
    ]}}'
```

> Example Response 

```json
{
    "Data": {
        "Status": "AwaitingAuthorisation",
        "ConsentId": "123"
    }
}
```
### Request

**`POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/account-access-consents`**

Using the `access-token` returned from [Creating an Access Token](#open-banking-1-create-an-access-token) you can create a new consent object. Use the authorization header:

`Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx` 

The payload of this request will look different depending on whether you're an AISP, PISP or CBPII. For an AISP you'll need to specify a set of permissions describing the access that you wish to gain on behalf of the end user.

### Permissions

For AISPs the list of supported permissions is:

* ReadAccountsBasic
* ReadAccountsDetail
* ReadBalances
* ReadTransactionsBasic
* ReadTransactionsCredits
* ReadTransactionsDebits
* ReadTransactionsDetail

### Response

The response will be JSON data reflecting the newly created consent object. There are two important return values to highlight here.

* `Data.Status` will contain `AwaitingAuthorisation` because this consent has not been authorized by the user yet.   
* `Data.ConsentId` will contain the unique identifier assigned to your consent object. Save this, as you'll need it later.
  
## 3. User Flow

> Example Authorization Request

```shell
https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/authorize?
  response_type=code%20id_token&
  redirect_uri=https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect&
  scope=openid%20accounts&
  client_id=ob-dummy-tpp&
  state=state123&
  nonce=nonce123&
  request=eyJ0...sYjmjJg
```

> Example Authorization JWT Request

> HEADER

```json
{
   "kid" : "er84c2cYa6dAe57BV3278Pf",
   "alg" : "PS256",
   "typ" : "JWT"
}
```

> PAYLOAD

```json
{
   "scope" : "openid accounts",
   "response_type" : "code id_token",
   "sub" : "user_id",
   "claims" : {
      "id_token" : {
         "openbanking_intent_id" : {
            "essential" : true,
            "value" : "123"
         },
         "acr" : {
            "values" : [
               "urn:openbanking:psd2:sca",
               "urn:openbanking:psd2:ca"
            ],
            "essential" : true
         }
      },
      "userinfo" : {
         "openbanking_intent_id" : {
            "value" : "123",
            "essential" : true
         }
      }
   },
   "iss" : "ob-dummy-tpp",
   "client_id" : "ob-dummy-tpp",
   "aud" : "https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech",
   "exp" : 2499287201,
   "iat" : 2499283601,
   "max_age" : 86400,
   "redirect_uri" : "https://ob-dummy-tpp/redirect"
}
```

At the moment we are only supporting the browser redirect flow ([Hybrid Flow](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/83919096/Open+Banking+Security+Profile+-+Implementer+s+Draft+v1.1.2#OpenBankingSecurityProfile-Implementer'sDraftv1.1.2-HybridFlowRequestwithIntentId)) for authorizing the created consent.

The customer journey will start from the TPPs website from where a user action will trigger a redirect to the TransferWise Open Banking Authorization Endpoint

**`GET https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/openbanking/authorize`**

Parameter      | Required    | Description
---------      | -------     | -----------
response_type  | Mandatory   | code id_token
redirect_uri   | Mandatory   | One of the pre-registered redirect URIs
scope          | Mandatory   | Must include `openid` plus any requested scope
client_id      | Mandatory   | Pre-registered clientId of the TPP 
request        | Mandatory   | JWT Request Object
state          | Optional    | If present, it must also be present in the JWT
nonce          | Optional    | If present, it must also be present in the JWT

You can take a look at the example JWT request object on the right. Please note that:

* Every request parameter sent in the URL **must** also be present in the signed JWT.
* The `aud` claim should be correctly filled as `https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech`
* The `openbanking_intent_id` **must** be filled with a valid `ConsentId` issued to the TPP.
* The JWT **must** be signed with a valid signing certificate.

Once the TPP redirects the user browser to the Authorization Endpoint the following things will happen in order:

1. User Login (use the username and password from the [Test User Registration](#open-banking-sandbox-test-user))
2. Pass 2FA challenge (User the code `111111` in sandbox)
3. Select profile you wish to give access to (Business or Personal)
4. Review and Authorize Consent 
5. Redirect back to TPP

As part of the last step, the user browser is redirected to the TPP with the following parameters

Parameter     | Required    | Description
---------     | -------     | -----------
code          | Mandatory   | The `authorization_code` issued as the request of the request
id_token      | Mandatory   | Signed JWT containing details about the authorization
state         | Optional    | In case it was provided with the request

Note that in case the authorization request fails either because of a validation error on the request, or because the enduser drops off, we still redirect the user browser to the TPP with an error response of the following format:

Field             | Description                                | Format
---------         | -------                                    | ---------
error             | Error code according to [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1)                           | Text
error_description | Detailed explanation of error                 | Text

## 4. Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token

> Example Token Request

```shell
curl -X POST \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fob-dummy-tpp%2Fredirect&code=abcdauthcode'
```

> Example Response

```json 
{
    "access_token": "zzzzzzzz-1111-2222-3333-zzzzzzzzzzzz",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "refresh_token": "refreshr-efre-shre-fres-hrefreshrefr",
    "expires_in": 6000,
    "scope": "accounts consent-id:123 openbanking openid"
}
```

Once you get the authorization `code` after the browser redirect, you'll have to call the Token Endpoint to exchange this for a valid access token.

### Request

**`POST https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/auth/token`**

Field          | Description                    | Format
---------      | -------                        | -----------
grant_type     | OAuth Grant Type               | `authorization_code`
redirect_uri   | Pre-registered redirect Uri    | URI
code           | Authorization Code             | Text

### Response

Field          | Description                                | Format
---------      | -------                                    | ---------
access_token   | The access token                           | Text
expires_in     | Expiration time in seconds                 | Long
scope          | The scopes you have been given access to   | Text  
refresh_token  | Refresh Token for refreshing access token  | Text

## 5. Query the API

> Example Request

```shell
curl -X GET \
  https://openbanking.sandbox.transferwise.tech/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts \
  --cacert CA.pem --cert client.pem --key client.key \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer zzzzzzzz-1111-2222-3333-zzzzzzzzzzzz' \
```

> Example Response

```json
{
    "Data": {
        "Account": [
            {
                "AccountId": "504",
                "Currency": "GBP",
                "AccountType": "Personal",
                "AccountSubType": "EMoney",
                "Account": [
                    {
                        "SchemeName": "UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber",
                        "Identification": "230xxx1000xxxx",
                        "Name": "John Smith (GBP)"
                    }
                ],
                "Servicer": {
                    "SchemeName": "UK.OBIE.BICFI",
                    "Identification": "TRWIGB22"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

With the `access-token` from [Authorization Code Flow](#open-banking-4-exchange-authorization-code-for-access-token) used in the Authorization header, you'll be able to query the data endpoints.

`Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx`

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

## AISP Interfaces

### Accounts

Querying the accounts endpoint will return all open currency accounts of the consented user. 

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts`**

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/{id}`**

**Note:** Not every Borderless Account opened in TransferWise has a unique set of bank details attached to it. Therefore, it's expected that some of the currency accounts returned will have an empty `OBReadAccount3/Data/Account/Account`. We encourage AISPs to instead use the unique id `OBReadAccount3/Data/Account/AccountId` for identifying different accounts. There's nothing inherently different between accounts with and without bank details, you can call the **Balances** and **Transactions** endpoints for either of them.

### Balances

Querying the balances endpoint will return the current running balance of a specific account.

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/{id}/balances`**

### Transactions

Querying the transactions endpoint will return a list of transactions from within the consented time window.

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/{id}/transactions`**

We are fully transparent about our transaction charges, so you will find fees attached to transactions in either of the following ways:

* **Embedded** *[DEFAULT]*: Using the `OBReadTransaction5/Data/Transaction/ChargeAmount` object. Fees represented this way will be embedded into the transactions amount. This might make sense for most AISPs.
* **Fee Split** : Showing fees as separate DEBIT transactions with an attached reference to the original transaction. Fees represented this way will not be embedded in the original transaction amount. This might make sense for some AISPs, like account software providers.    

## PISP Interfaces

Every consent object created for initiating payments will have a **`CutOffDateTime`** attached which is set to be **30 minutes** after the creation of the consent. After the 30 minutes have lapsed, the Payment Order creation will be rejected. 

We are supporting both **`UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber`** as well as **`UK.OBIE.IBAN`** for account identification.  

The accepted size of the **`EndToEndIdentification`** field varies based on the currency of the transfer. For EUR transfers you'll be able to leverage the full length of **35** characters of this field, however for GBP transfers this field length is restricted to a maximum of **18** characters. The reason for this restriction is also detailed in [OB Payment Message Format Mapping](https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/999819767/Domestic+Payment+Message+Formats+-+v3.1.1#DomesticPaymentMessageFormats-v3.1.1-Mapping). In case of FPS, this field gets mapped to both ISO8583 Field 62 as well as Field 120.   

### Domestic Payments

**`POST /open-banking/v3.1/pisp/domestic-payments`**

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/pisp/domestic-payments/{id}`**

The Domestic Payments endpoint can be used to initiate same currency transfers. You can initiate domestic payments in any of the [supported currencies](https://transferwise.com/gb/borderless/) by TransferWise, assuming the consenting user already holds an open account in the requested currency. 

### International Payments

**`POST /open-banking/v3.1/pisp/international-payments`**

**`GET /open-banking/v3.1/pisp/international-payments/{id}`**

The International Payments endpoint can be used to initiate transfers where the source currency is different than the target currency. You can use it to initiate a payment with:

* Fixed **Source** Amount : `OBInternational2/InstructedAmount/Currency` and `OBInternational2/CurrencyOfTransfer` are different.

    * The source currency and amount are specified using `OBInternational2/InstructedAmount`. The currency can be any of the [supported currencies](https://transferwise.com/gb/borderless/) by TransferWise, assuming the consenting user already holds an open account in the requested currency.  
    * The target currency of the transfer is specified using `OBInternational2/CurrencyOfTransfer`. The instructed amount will be converted to the CurrencyOfTransfer and sent out to the specified CreditorAccount.<br /><br />

* Fixed **Target** Amount : `OBInternational2/InstructedAmount/Currency` and `OBInternational2/CurrencyOfTransfer` are the same.

    * The source currency of the transfer can either be specified using `OBInternational2/ExchangeRateInformation/UnitCurrency`, or it can be left unspecified, allowing the TransferWise customer to choose one of his eligible currency accounts during the Authorization Flow. The customer's choice of source currency, the exchange rate used, and any additional charges are clearly communicated to the customer as well as reflected to the TPP via the Payment Resource.
    * The target currency and amount are specified using `OBInternational2/InstructedAmount`. 

We are only supporting **INDICATIVE** `ExchangeRateInformation` during the creation of the International Payment Consent. The real exchange rate used, along with any fees will be clearly communicated to the customer during the consent authorization, as well as reflected to the PISP during the creation of the International Payment Resource.   

## CBPII Interfaces

**`POST /open-banking/v3.1/cbpii/funds-confirmations`**

The confirmation of funds endpoint can be used to check whether the consented user has a specific amount on any of its [opened currency accounts](https://transferwise.com/gb/borderless/).
