# Application Webhooks

Application webhook subscription is a mechanism that will allow you to receive notifications to your servers whenever various events happen in relation to different resources created by an ***application***.

Before proceeding, make sure the endpoint where you intend to receive webhooks satisfies the following requirements:

* Has a valid domain name (IP addresses are disallowed)
* Listens to HTTPS requests on port `443`
* Has a valid HTTPS certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority - CA (self-signed or expired certificates are not accepted)
* Does not include any query arguments in the URL

`https://webhooks.example.com/balance-change` is a valid URL; `http://webhooks.example.com:8080/hook.php?type=balance` is not.

You can have multiple subscriptions per event type though be mindful you will receive duplicate callbacks, one for each subscription. Find out more about webhook events [here](#webhook-events).

Please note that you have to use a client level token to access application subscription resources.

## Test notifications

Test notifications can be generated for existing application subscriptions using the API.

Test notifications will have the correct structure for their source subscription's event type and version,
and will contain "dummy" data. These data include random UUIDs, entity IDs of zero, current dates and times,
and hard-coded status codes.

Test notifications are delivered with the usual notification HTTP request headers, including a unique delivery ID for the 
notification, and a "test notification" flag set to true. You can check for the presence of this test flag to
determine that an incoming notification is a test notification which should not be processed as real data.
See the section [Event HTTP requests](#webhook-events-event-http-requests) for more information on request headers.

When test notifications are created with the API, they are queued for sending in the same way as non-test notifications.
This means that there may be some delay in notification delivery, and delivery failures will result in attempts to 
redeliver the notification later.
The API returns the delivery IDs of the notifications that have been successfully queued for sending, which can 
be correlated with the delivery ID header values for notifications you later receive.

<aside class="notice">
Please note that this test notification API is only available for application-based subscriptions.
Profile-based subscriptions do not currently support this testing feature.
