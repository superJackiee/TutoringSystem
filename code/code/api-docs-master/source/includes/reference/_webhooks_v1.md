## Events

Events are messages that will be sent to your server as HTTP `POST` requests.
They will not contain any personally identifiable information.

To acknowledge that you have successfully processed an event, make sure your server answers with a `2xx`-series HTTP status
code within 5 seconds. Otherwise, we will consider the delivery attempt as having failed and will later try to resend the message.

We will attempt to redeliver messages at increasing intervals over a two week period. We will try at most 25 times to do this.


### Signature header

> TransferWise public key for production environment:

```
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAvO8vXV+JksBzZAY6GhSO
XdoTCfhXaaiZ+qAbtaDBiu2AGkGVpmEygFmWP4Li9m5+Ni85BhVvZOodM9epgW3F
bA5Q1SexvAF1PPjX4JpMstak/QhAgl1qMSqEevL8cmUeTgcMuVWCJmlge9h7B1CS

```

> How to verify signatures (in Java):

```java
public boolean verifySignature(String encodedPublicKey, String signature, String payload) {
  X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(Base64.getMimeDecoder().decode(encodedPublicKey));
  KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA");
  PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
  
  Signature sign = Signature.getInstance("SHA1WithRSA");
  sign.initVerify(publicKey);
  sign.update(payload.getBytes());
  
  byte[] signatureBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(signature);
  
  return sign.verify(signatureBytes);
}
```

Each outgoing webhook request is signed. Whilst event payloads do not contain any sensitive information, you may want to
verify if the request is coming from TransferWise (however this is optional).
We advise you not to process any requests where signature appears to be forged.

Each `POST` request includes `X-Signature` header, which contains a signature.


## Test event

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.transferwise.com/v1/webhooks/ping \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
       "callback_url": "<URL of your server>"
      }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "code": 200,
  "elapsed": 228
}
```

You can trigger a test event to be delivered to your server to check the connection between systems.
