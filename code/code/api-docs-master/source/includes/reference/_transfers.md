In case not it will get automatically cancelled.

### Avoiding duplicate transfers
We use **customerTransactionId** field to avoid duplicate transfer requests. 
When your first call fails (error or timeout) then you should use the same value in **customerTransactionId** field that you used in the original call when you are submitting a retry message. 
This way we can treat subsequent retry messages as **repeat messages** and will not create duplicate transfers to your account. 


## Fund

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v3/profiles/{profileId}/transfers/{transferId}/payments \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ 
          "type": "BALANCE"   
         }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "type": "BALANCE",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

This API call is the final step for executing payouts. TransferWise will now debit funds from your borderless balance and start processing your transfer. 
If your borderless balance is short of funds then this call will fail with "insufficient funds" error.

### Request

**`POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v3/profiles/{profileId}/transfers/{transferId}/payments`**

Use transfer id that you obtained in previous step.

Almost every country has its own specific nuances when it comes to the nitty gritty details of domestic payment systems and money transfer regulations. 
The maximum allowed length of reference text is a good example. The US payment system, ACH, supports 10 characters only, but transfers within Mexico allow up to 100 characters, and so on.

The same is true for requirements arising from Anti-Money Laundering regulations adopted in different countries. Depending on the chosen currencies and the amount transfer, either in one go or cumulatively over time, TransferWise may require more details about the customer's source of funds or transfer purpose, for example.

The endpoint `/transfer-requirements` exposes all these specific requirements based on the specific quote and selected target recipient account.

To make sure that processing of your customer's transfers does not get delayed because of missing details, we highly recommend to verify the transfer requirements before before submitting any transfer and collecting the data we request from the user using the returned dynamic form.


### Request
**` POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v1/transfer-requirements`**<br/>


1.Prepare the request body to create transfer object first. 
Now post this request body to the `transfer-requirements` endpoint to figure out if there are any other required fields.


2.Analyze the returned list of fields. Our example includes reference, sourceOfFunds and transferPurpose fields.  Field 'reference' is optional. Fields 'sourceOfFunds' and 'transferPurpose' are required and both have 
refreshRequirementsOnChange=true which indicates that there could be additional fields required depending on the selected value.

In our example you will have to POST request to/v1/transfer-requirements` second time as well with values set for 'transferPurpose' and 'sourceOfFunds'.
So in case you set sourceOfFunds = 'verification.source.of.funds.other'  then another text field called "sourceOfFundsOther" is also required where you need to specify the details in free format.

3.Once you get to the point where you have provided values for all fields which have refreshRequirementsOnChange=true then you have complete set of fields to compose a valid request to create a transfer object. 
For example this is a valid request to create a transfer.
<br/> POST /v1/transfers:<br/>
