# Language Support
Internationalisation support for translation of strings returned by the API is supported for the following endpoints:

Endpoint                                    |
---------                                   |
`/v1/quotes`                                |
`/v1/quotes/<quoteId>/account-requirements` |
`/v1/accounts`                              |
`/v1/transfers`                             |


When calling these endpoints if you include an `Accept-Language` header with a supported language code as the value then strings will be returned in the requested language. The languages supported by TransferWise are:
