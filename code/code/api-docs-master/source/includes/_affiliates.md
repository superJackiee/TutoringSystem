# Affiliates Integration Guide

## API access

Once you become our affiliate we will send you TransferWise API access credentials: api_client_id & api_client_secret. 
You can then use these as username and password with **Basic Authentication** method.

There are two endpoints [Exchange Rates.List](#exchange-rates-list) and [Get Temporary Quote](#quotes-get-temporary-quote) which you can call with this authentication method.

### TEST and LIVE environments

* Sandbox API is located at https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech

**Is currency route supported?**

If we don't support a route then this endpoint will respond with an error code "error.route.not.supported".

**How much does a transfer cost?**

The TransferWise fee is included in the response. 

**How long does my transfer take?**

Estimated delivery time is included in the response. 
This can vary quite a lot for different currency routes. For example transfers often only take a few hours from EUR to GBP, while sending money from USD can take 1-2 business days. 
This endpoint allows you to find out the estimated delivery time for each currency route.
