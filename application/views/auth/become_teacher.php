                <p>There are currently two types of teaching profile on My language Pro. Consider which one is most appropriate for you:</p>
                <h6>Professional Teaching profile</h6>
                <ul>
                	<li><p>Professional teachers have training as educators and/or extensive professional teaching experience. They can provide students with resources, prepared materials, and structured lesson plans to help students reach their goals.</p></li>
                	<li><p>To apply for a professional teaching profile, you must upload documents showing your training and experience as an educator.</p></li>
                </ul>
              
                <h5>What you need to teach on My language Pro:</h5>

                <h6>1. "Native" or Advanced (C2) language proficiency</h6>

                <p>My language Pro currently requires language proficiency of Advanced (C2) or "Native" level in order to create courses and teach a language. My language Pro uses the <a href="javascript:void(0);"> Common European Framework of Reference for Languages</a> for reporting language proficiency. You can read more about language requirements<a href="javascript:void(0);"> here.</a></p>

                <h6>2. Reliable access to an internet connection</h6>
                <p>My language Pro teachers teach online. You will need regular access to the internet to:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li><p>Give your lessons online.</p></li>
                	<li><p>Accept lesson requests from students. Requests will expire if you do not respond within 48 hours.</p></li>
                	<li><p>Communicate with your students and manage your teaching profile.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>You should have reliable access to an internet connection with a speed of <b>at least 2 MB per second.</b></p>
                <p>You can test your connection speed here and improve your connection speed<a href="javascript:void(0);"> here.</a></p>

                <h6>3. VOIP software (Skype, Hangouts, Facetime, or QQ)</h6>

                <p>My language Pro currently supports <a href="javascript:void(0);"> Skype,</a> <a href="javascript:void(0);"> Google Hangouts,</a> Facetime, and<a href="javascript:void(0);"> QQ. </a>You must download, install, and create an account using one of these options before your first lesson. All are free to use for calling between computers. Most students and teachers use Skype.</p>

                <p>Make sure that this software is working on your device:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>
                		<a href="javascript:void(0);">Test your Skype connection</a>
                	</li>
                	<li>
                		<a href="javascript:void(0);">Verify Hangouts Sound and Video</a>
                	</li>
                	<li>
                		<a href="javascript:void(0);">Facetime requirements</a>
                	</li>
                	<li>
                		<a href="javascript:void(0);">QQ System requirements</a>
                	</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To protect your privacy,<b> do not</b> give out your personal account information to students or post it on your profile. When a student requests a session with you, My language Pro will provide you and your student with the contact details so that you can add each other on your chosen communication platform.</p>

                <h6>4. External microphone and/or webcam</h6>
                <p>Using an external camera or microphone typically provides better audio/video quality than using your device's built-in camera or microphone.</p>

                <h6>5. An My language Pro user profile</h6>
                <p>Register for a free profile on <a href="javascript:void(0);">My language Pro.</a> After creating your account, you can apply for a teaching account.</p>
                <h6>6. A completed teaching application</h6>
                <p>Log into your My language Pro account and click on "I'm interested in teaching". Follow the links to complete your online application. If approved, this application will become your teaching profile.</p>
                <p>You can also follow this direct link after logging in.</p>
                <p>We are typically able to review applications within 2 weeks after they are submitted. You will receive an email once your application has been reviewed.</p>

                <h5>What you need to complete your application:</h5>
                <p>Remember that your profile is what students will consider when choosing a teacher and lessons. Consider how your profile will look to students, and choose pictures and an introduction that represents you at your best.</p>

                <h6>1. A "display name" that suits you.</h6>

                <p>The online application will ask for your first name and your last name. It will also ask for a "display name". This does not need to be your real or legal name, but it should be a name that you expect your students to call you. Please do not enter an online handle or nickname, since this does not make your profile seem like a real person.</p>
                <h6>Acceptable "display names":</h6>

                <ul>
                	<li><p>"Mr. B", "Teacher Marie", "Chen Yifei", or "Kathy" are all acceptable</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Not acceptable:</h6>

                <ul>
                	<li><p>"TOEFL Teacher" (instead of putting "TOEFL" in your name, you can add it as a "teaching specialties" tag so students who want to take the TOEFL can search for you using the "exam" tag).</p></li>
                	<li><p>"anime451" (please do not use an online nickname or handle).</p></li>
                	<li><p>"English Tutor" (please do not use a name that cannot distinguish you from others).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h6>2. An appropriate profile picture</h6>

                <p>Your profile picture must be of you and must clearly show your face.</p>
                <h6>3. Accurate language levels</h6>
                <p>Your language levels for the languages you teach must be accurate.</p>
                <h6>4. A written introduction</h6>
                <p>Your written introduction should tell your students about yourself and what you offer. You might include your approach to teaching and language learning, as well as some interesting information about you and your background.</p>
                <h6>5. A video introduction</h6>
                <p>Your video introduction must introduce yourself and your lessons (you must speak in every language in which you are C2 or "native" level).</p>
                <h6>6.  Documentation of training or experience</h6>
                <p>This documentation of training or experience only applies to people who want to become a Professional Teacher.</p>
                <h6>If your application is accepted</h6>
                <p>You will receive an email and a notification next time you log into My language Pro. Then, you will be able to add:</p>

                <ul>
                	<li><p>Your calendar of availability.</p></li>
                	<li><p>Your lessons and prices.</p></li>
                	<li><p>Lesson Packages and Trial Lessons (optional)</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Please note that the changes you make to your profile photo, video, and other information must be first approved by My language Pro staff before they will be displayed on your profile.</p>
                <h6>If your application is declined</h6>
                <ul>
                	<li>
                		<p>You will receive an email. The email will tell you why your application was declined and will let you know what you can do to improve and resubmit your application if you wish.</p>
                	</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your application was declined it is because there was a problem with the quality of the application or current language demand needs at the time of application. My language Pro does not discriminate based on sex, race or location.</p>
                <h6>Common reasons for declined applications</h6>
                <p>We expect all teachers to conduct themselves professionally and to bring an enthusiasm for language teaching and learning.</p>
                <p>ere are some of the most common reasons why applications are declined.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>
                		<p>The application is <b>incomplete.</b> An approved application would immediately become your teaching profile, so we will not accept any incomplete applications.</p>
                	</li>
                	<li><p><b>Profile Picture</b> is not professional-looking. It doesn't have to be formal or business-like, but it does have to follow our guidelines.</p></li>
                	<li><p>No <b>introduction video,</b> the video link is set to "private" and not viewable by My language Pro staff or by students, or the image or sound quality is low and cannot be clearly viewed.</p></li>
                	<li><p>he <b>Written Introduction</b>needs more information or has spelling/grammar mistakes in the target language(s).</p></li>
                	<li><p>Something in your profile <b>advertises or promotes other services.</b> We ask that you respect the My language Pro platform and not promote other services.</p></li>
                	<li><p>Your profile includes<b> personal contact information.</b> On My language Pro, you work for yourself, but don't give out your personal contact information. Students will be able to contact you through My language Pro messages. This is to protect your privacy.</p></li>
                	<li><p>You do not meet the<b> minimum age requirement</b> of 18 years old</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It does sometimes happen that we receive too many applications for a teaching particular language, and must decline them even if they follow our guidelines and are good applications. In this situation, we ask for your patience and invite you to reapply again in a few months when there might be a better chance of acceptance. </p>
